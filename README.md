# Kaggle-July-TPS tps-july-simple-sarima-model.ipynb 
First ever competition on Kaggle, an introduction for myself to the competitions, it's a time series analysis for  predicting the pollution levels of three pollutants over time. 

Being a novice, i have explored the data in the most simple and straight forward manner. 
Also I am going to write down the major elements of the notebook in brief. 

## Time Analysis
- AR/MA time model
- ARIMA / SARIMA model wiht various orders
- Accuracy with Mean Absolute Percentage Error(MAPE)

## Regression analysis
- Robust Scaling (Outliers)
- Ridge Regression (Multicollinearity)
